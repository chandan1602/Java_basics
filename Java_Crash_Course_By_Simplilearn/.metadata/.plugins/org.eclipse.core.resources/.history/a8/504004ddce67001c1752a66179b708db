/*
 * 
 * Popular perception : Non Blocking IO
 * Classic meaning: Networking IO
 * 
 * Package created is java.nio
 * -Purpose of package is to support IO in multi-threading and non-blocking
 * 
 * -Some concepts are:
 * Buffers:
 	-read operation: from channel into the buffer
 	-write operation: from buffer into the channel
 	
 	1. Buffers are containers for data
 		Channels are basically like wires, represents connections to
 		the entities capable of performing IO operations 
 		
 	2. popular ops:
 		a. read() : for reading contents(bytes) from file
 		b. flip() : ready for a new sequence of channel-write
