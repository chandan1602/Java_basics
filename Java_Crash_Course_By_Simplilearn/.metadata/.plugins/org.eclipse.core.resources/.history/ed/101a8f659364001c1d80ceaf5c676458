/*
 * 
 * -Process 
 * has a self-contained execution environment.
 * has a complete, private set of basic run-time resources,
 * has its own memory space
 * 
 * -Threads
 * lightweight processes
 * process can have multiple threads
 * creating thread required less resources than creating a process
 * Thread has different states:
 * 	1. ready
 * 	2. running
 * 	3. waiting for IO from user
 * 	4. dead when execution complete
 * 	5. sleep when thread is paused
 * 
 * Two different ways of implementing thread
 * 1. extends Thread
 * Most simple use case
 * 
 * 2. implements Runnable
 * Used when we are already inheriting one class, so we can't 
 * inherit Thread Class because java doesn't support Multiple Inheritance
